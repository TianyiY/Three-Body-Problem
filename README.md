# Three-Body-Problem

The classic three body problem

-Simulated the trajectories of the three stars in a three-body system.

-Used the Newton's law and solved the PDE by Euler's forward method and Heun's method.

-Used both fixed step size and adaptive step size.

-The initial position and velocity was assumed.
